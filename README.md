# AutoGrid

For automatic grid updates with animation.


### Intended usage

```
GridAdapter = new GridAdapter();
GridAdapter.add(new MyItem());
```

And it automatically lays out the item in a grid, recalculating the number of rows and columns needed, and the size of the item.

Also animates the adding/removing of the item, and allows temporary removing and re-adding of one item at a time.

This is not a library, not yet at least.
